## Python Example: Output Item Based Recommendation Using Ego Network

The task for the assignment was to output a recommendation given an Amazon book title using graph theory ego network techniques

```python
import networkx
from operator import itemgetter
import matplotlib.pyplot

# Read the data from the amazon-books.txt;
# populate amazonProducts nested dicitonary;
# key = ASIN; value = MetaData associated with ASIN
fhr = open('./amazon-books.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore')
amazonBooks = {}
fhr.readline()
for line in fhr:
    cell = line.split('\t')
    MetaData = {}
    MetaData['Id'] = cell[0].strip()
    ASIN = cell[1].strip()
    MetaData['Title'] = cell[2].strip()
    MetaData['Categories'] = cell[3].strip()
    MetaData['Group'] = cell[4].strip()
    MetaData['Copurchased'] = cell[5].strip()
    MetaData['SalesRank'] = int(cell[6].strip())
    MetaData['TotalReviews'] = int(cell[7].strip())
    MetaData['AvgRating'] = float(cell[8].strip())
    MetaData['DegreeCentrality'] = int(cell[9].strip())
    MetaData['ClusteringCoeff'] = float(cell[10].strip())
    amazonBooks[ASIN] = MetaData
fhr.close()

# Read the data from amazon-books-copurchase.adjlist;
# assign it to copurchaseGraph weighted Graph;
# node = ASIN, edge= copurchase, edge weight = category similarity
fhr=open("amazon-books-copurchase.edgelist", 'rb')
copurchaseGraph=networkx.read_weighted_edgelist(fhr)
fhr.close()

# let's assume a person is considering buying the following book;
# what else can we recommend to them based on copurchase behavior
# we've seen from other users?
print ("Looking for Recommendations for Customer Purchasing this Book:")
print ("--------------------------------------------------------------")
purchasedAsin = '0805047905'

# Let's first get some metadata associated with this book
print ("ASIN = ", purchasedAsin)
print ("Title = ", amazonBooks[purchasedAsin]['Title'])
print ("SalesRank = ", amazonBooks[purchasedAsin]['SalesRank'])
print ("TotalReviews = ", amazonBooks[purchasedAsin]['TotalReviews'])
print ("AvgRating = ", amazonBooks[purchasedAsin]['AvgRating'])
print ("DegreeCentrality = ", amazonBooks[purchasedAsin]['DegreeCentrality'])
print ("ClusteringCoeff = ", amazonBooks[purchasedAsin]['ClusteringCoeff'])

# Now let's look at the ego network associated with purchasedAsin in the
# copurchaseGraph - which is esentially comprised of all the books
# that have been copurchased with this book in the past
#     Get the depth-1 ego network of purchasedAsin from copurchaseGraph,
#     and assign the resulting graph to purchasedAsinEgoGraph.
purchasedAsinEgoGraph = networkx.ego_graph(copurchaseGraph,purchasedAsin,radius=1)
#print(purchasedAsin, round(networkx.average_clustering(purchasedAsinEgoGraph),2))

# Next, recall that the edge weights in the copurchaseGraph is a measure of
# the similarity between the books connected by the edge. So we can use the
# island method to only retain those books that are highly similar to the
# purchasedAsin
#     Use the island method on purchasedAsinEgoGraph to only retain edges with
#     threshold >= 0.5, and assign resulting graph to purchasedAsinEgoTrimGraph

threshold = 0.5
purchasedAsinEgoTrimGraph = networkx.Graph()
for f, t, e in purchasedAsinEgoGraph.edges(data=True):
    if e['weight'] >= threshold:
        purchasedAsinEgoTrimGraph.add_edge(f,t,weight=e['weight'])


# Note that, given the purchasedAsinEgoTrimGraph you constructed above,
# you can get at the list of nodes connected to the purchasedAsin by a single
# hop (called the neighbors of the purchasedAsin) as below.

purchasedAsinNeighbors = purchasedAsinEgoTrimGraph.neighbors(purchasedAsin)

# Next, let's pick the Top Five book recommendations from among the
# purchasedAsinNeighbors based on one or more of the following data of the
# neighboring nodes: SalesRank, AvgRating, TotalReviews, DegreeCentrality,
# and ClusteringCoeff
#     Note that, given an asin, you can get at the metadata associated with  
#     it using amazonBooks (similar to lines 50-57 above).
#     Now, come up with a method to make Top Five book recommendations based
#     on one or more of the following metrics associated with nodes in
#     purchasedAsinNeighbors: SalesRank, AvgRating, TotalReviews,
#     DegreeCentrality, and ClusteringCoeff

#clustering coefficient threshold 0.90
#Average Rating threshold 5
# Sales Rank Threshold 150,000

ccThreshold = .9
ratingThreshold = 4.5
salesRankThreshold = 150000

#Tuple for Recommendations
bookRecommendations = []

#apply thresholds and put in t
for neighborAsin in purchasedAsinNeighbors:
    if amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['AvgRating'] >= ratingThreshold and \
    amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['ClusteringCoeff'] >= ccThreshold and \
    amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['SalesRank'] <= salesRankThreshold:
        bookRecommendations.append([neighborAsin,amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['Title'],amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['SalesRank'], amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['TotalReviews'], \
                                   amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['AvgRating'], amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['DegreeCentrality'], \
                                   amazonBooks[neighborAsin]['ClusteringCoeff']])

top5Recommendations = sorted(bookRecommendations, key = lambda x: (x[4],x[3],x[2]), reverse = True)[:5]
# Print Top 5 recommendations (ASIN, and associated Title, Sales Rank,
# TotalReviews, AvgRating, DegreeCentrality, ClusteringCoeff)
# (4) YOUR CODE HERE:  
print()
print('The top 5 recommended books are:')
for neighborAsin in top5Recommendations:
    print(neighborAsin)
