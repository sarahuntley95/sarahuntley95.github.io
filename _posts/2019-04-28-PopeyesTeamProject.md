## Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Business Intelligence Presentation

Our team was required to work with a business, utilize our skills learned in our program, and provide recommendations to improve business processes. This project showcases business strategy, data cleansing techniques, visualizations through a Tableau dashboard, forecasting net sales, and optimization of labor costs.

###Executive Summary

A fast food franchise owner, Paul Singh, recently opened a new Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in Lynden, Washington. Paul is interested in applying data-driven analytical techniques in order to maximize the profitability of the new restaurants. Provided with a limited five month data set and minimal direction, our approach was to analyze each of the key profit margin drivers that Paul outlined, including net sales, customer count, location near the Canadian border, and labor hours and their associated costs. The data we received from Paul was a set of manually populated Excel spreadsheets that tracked daily net sales, customer counts, the breakdown of drive thru sales, dine in sales and several other attributes. In order to complete our analysis, we relied primarily on Excel and Tableau to identify correlations, project future sales, and prepare an optimized labor schedule.

The key results of our analysis focused on labor optimization and drivers of net sales. Using the data we were provided, we projected net sales for a typical week, and utilized those results to create an optimal labor schedule to bring labor hours to within a threshold that Paul desired. Similarly, we disproved an assumption Paul had about traffic crossing the Canadian border being a driver of net sales.

We were able to draw two main conclusions. The first conclusion was that Paul is scheduling too many employees from Monday to Thursday, and would be better off shifting those employees to the Friday and Saturday shifts. The second conclusion was that traffic to and from the border wasnâ€™t as impactful as Paul believed. Paul told us that border traffic was a significant source of his sales, however we found very little correlation between border traffic and sales. Our recommendation was to focus marketing efforts on local customers, as they are the drivers of his sales.  

The limitations of our approach to this analysis were related to the data we were provided. Limited in volume, veracity, and variety, we could only scratch the surface of the analysis we could perform and validate. We found that the data was heavily skewed as a result of the increased sales the restaurant experienced during its first month of operations. While we feel our approach was sound, without a years worth of data, at a minimum, it is difficult to account for seasonality and adjust for the aforementioned skew.
