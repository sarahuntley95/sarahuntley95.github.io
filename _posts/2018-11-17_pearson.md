## Python Example: Calculate Pearson Correlation

The task for the assignment was to solve the Pearson Correlation between to user rating datasets.

```python
import math

# Pearson Correlation between two vectors
def pearsonD(ratings1, ratings2):
    n = len(ratings1.keys() & ratings2.keys())
    sumpq = 0
    sump = 0
    sumq = 0
    sump2 = 0
    sumq2 = 0

    for i in ratings1.keys():
        if i in ratings2.keys():
            p = ratings1[i]
            q = ratings2[i]
            sumpq += p * q
            sump += p
            sumq += q
            sump2 += pow(p,2)
            sumq2 += pow(q,2)
    num = (sumpq -(sump * sumq) / n)
    denom = (math.sqrt(sump2 - pow(sump,2) / n) * math.sqrt(sumq2 - pow(sumq,2) / n))
    r = num/denom
    return r
    # (1) your code here
    #     remember to derive n as the number of common keys
    #     remember to use the computationally efficient form of pearson correlation
    #     remember to use a single for loop
    #     remember to consider an item only if it was rated by both users
    #     remember to return calculated pearson correlation value

# user ratings    
UserPRatings = {'Apple':1, 'Samsung':5, 'Nokia':7, 'Motorola':8, 'LG':5, 'Sony':1, 'Blackberry':7}
UserQRatings = {'Apple':7, 'Samsung':1, 'Nokia':4, 'LG':4, 'Sony':6, 'Blackberry':3}

# (2) your code here
#     remember to call the function
#     remember to print the returned value

p = pearsonD(UserPRatings,UserQRatings)
print("The pearson correlation is: ", round(p,4))
```

The Pearson Correlation outcome is -0.7307 meaning these two vectors are negatively correlated.
